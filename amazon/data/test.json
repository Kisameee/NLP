He played John Prine for my slightly older brother and i . We were way too young to have an opinion on that . Then he threaded a Cat Stevens recording . We liked that more . Finally our eldest brother played DON'T SHOOT ME...I'M ONLY THE PIANO PLAYER . WOW . Paydirt . One of the purest , most soulful musicians we'd ever heard . Then to find out he wrote and arranged all the music and deferred the lyric to another guy . Just like great song writing teams or yor . I was walking and listening to my i-pod the other day and put this recording on . It's a certainty that no musician in pop music led me to jazz more than Sir Elton .

I liked Island Girl, of course, and I Feel Like a Bullet, but the other songs struck me as fizzled rock.  Some tracks started out strong (Street Kids, for example) but never really established a hook.Now, some twenty-odd years later, as a 30-something adult, I find this record charming.  I also find it more satisfying that Captain Fantastic, which came out right before Rock of the Westies and which most fans consider superior.  I am now smitten with the American rock stylings of the record and admit, oddly, that it rocks.  It grooves, it churns, and it plunges from cut to cut.  This makes up for the occasional lack of chart-ready hooks.  Oddly, this record had three top forty hits, but Elton has rarely played any of them live since the CD's release.  Island Girl is the track that receive the most radio airplay today, but even then it's a surprise to hear it on the airwaves since so many other EJ songs receive first bidding.  The other two hits, Grow Some Funk of Your Own and I Feel Like a Bullet, are practically forgotten (Meaningless aside: one could compile a list of EJ's hits that are rarely heard on the radio anymore: Friends, Grow Some Funk, I Feel Like a Bullet, Chloe, Nobody Wins, A Word in Spanish, Mama Can't Buy You Love, Heartache All Over the World...)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not Fully Appreciated in Its Time", "unixReviewTime": 1237852800, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2009"}

Gross Georg \"imgeorg\"", "helpful": [4, 6], "reviewText": "I'm always a little thrown when I see more songs on the CD version than on the LP I bought in 1976 when I was 15! However, I forgive them this, since CDs are designed for more music, it would be a shortchange to only have the original songs, and the extra songs from the session are a treat to listen to!I remember this album was odd for a lot of reasons. One, the Elton John Band expanded to about ten people! James Newton Howard, Roger Pope, Ray Cooper, and a few others supplement the core EJ band of Nigel, Dee, and Davey. Another odd thing was Elton looking so darn scruffy on this album. I like to call this the second Caribou album, since it was recorded at the same Caribou Ranch studio the other was. Three, the songs were so LONG! Yell Help was flat odd, Street Kids was, well, interesting.\"Grow Some Funk of Your Own\" really showcased the late Dee Murray's outstanding bass work though; it was a true Motown track complete with groove break in the end! As an African-American who grew up with the real thing, I could appreciate the homage! Dee could have stood toe-to-toe with James Jamerson and done a respectable job as a stand-in funk brother. I've always been an admirer of his work. This song was the flip side of the single \"I Feel Like a Bullet\", and I remember playing the B side more. (For those too young to know what a flip side is, we used to play two-sided single recordings; the intended hit was the A side, and the spare was the flip or B side.)In my naive youth, I considered the one hit from the album, \"Island Girl\", a racist abomination, and was a little disappointed in Elton and the gang for even putting out such a thing. 30 years later, I'm still not fond of it, but I can forgive a musical genius the occasional boner now.I don't consider Rock of the Westies one of the young Elton John's better albums of the classic period, but it's not the worst, either.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Dee Murray Should Have Been a Funk Brother", "unixReviewTime": 1130198400, "reviewTime": "10 25, 2005"}

But very good nonetheless. Elton and his new lineup flex their muscles on what can be considered his last true &quot;rock&quot; album. Musically the album is top notch and Elton contributes some of his most underrated arrangements to date. The first side is as solid as anything since &quot;Dont Shoot Me&quot; and Elton is clearly enjoying himself. From &quot;Yell Help/Wednesday/Ugly&quot;, the funky medley that opens the album  straight on through the gorgeous &quot;Bullet In The Gun Of Robert Ford&quot; (a re-write of &quot;Someone Saved My Life Tonight&quot; but who cares?) there is not a bit of filler to be found. About the only weak moment here is &quot;Hard Luck Story&quot; but even so it hardly drags the album down. The last song &quot;Billy Bones&quot;, with it's Bo-Diddley beat and paranoid lyrics is another overlooked gem that will stick in your head long after it ends. Unfortunately as strong as the music is, the lyrics are somewhat disappointing this time out. Bernie must have been struggling with writers block (or alcoholism) to have served up such weak (by his standards) offerings as the &quot;Yell help&quot; medley that opens the album, &quot;Hard Luck Story&quot; and &quot;Feed Me&quot;. He seems preoccupied (more so than usual) with the seedy elements of society, namely prostitutes (&quot;Island Girl&quot;, &quot;Ugly&quot;), Junkies (&quot;Feed Me&quot;), gigolos (&quot;Grow Some Funk Of Your Own&quot;) and gangmembers (&quot;Street Kids&quot;). But I digress. The music is the big selling point here and makes for a rewarding listen.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A rock and roll masterpiece", "unixReviewTime": 1078185600, "reviewTime": "03 2, 2004"}
